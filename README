# MIDI to DMX


MIDI-TO-DMX uses node-dmx to connect to DMX devices through USB
https://github.com/wiedi/node-dmx
and node-midi.

Tested on a raspberry Pi 3 b+

## raspberry Pi notes

node-dmx depends on node-ftdi.
If its installation fails be sure to follow the instructions here:

node-midi installation requires to have libasound2-dev installed:

`apt install libasound2-dev`
